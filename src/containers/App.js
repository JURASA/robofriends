// PROPS are always inputs we get and we never change them
// STATE simply means the description of your app. A state is simply 
// an object that describes your application. The state is our robot 
// and whatever is entered into the searchbox, and we can change these values
// 
// PROPS are essentially things that come out of states.
// A parent feeds state into a child component, and as soon as a child 
// component receives a state, it's a property. That child can never 
// change that property. The parents just tells it what the state is and
// the child receives it as {robots}
//
// Thus, ALL react components are what are known as "pure functions" because
// Smart components usually have class syntax and are reactive
